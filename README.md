### Game Mechanics
- **Paddles**: Move up or down to prevent the ball from passing you. Player 1 uses the 'W' and 'S' keys, while Player 2 uses the Arrow Up and Arrow Down keys.
- **Ball Movement**: The ball bounces off the top and bottom walls and changes direction when it collides with a paddle. After each collision, the ballâ€™s speed gradually increases.

- **Pause**: Press the `ESC` key at any time to pause the game. Press any key to resume playing.

### Modes of Play
- **AI Mode**: In this mode, you will play against a computer-controlled opponent. The AI moves its paddle automatically, trying to block the ball from passing its side.
- **Human Mode**: In this mode, two players can play on the same machine, taking turns to control the paddles.
